# FUZ1 Midpoint Project Check


To run this project, visit the following website:

	http://3.16.15.0:8080/

A form will appear, to test the site, enter "http://aol.com"
You can try this with either breadth-first search or depth first search.
And select 1, 2, or 3 for the depth level.  The functionality for
the keyword has not been implemented yet.  Once all of the fields
have been entered, click "Submit".  The crawler will process the link, 
and the user will be redirected to a graph at https://capstone-graphics-portion.herokuapp.com/

Once the user gets to the graph, the user can hover over nodes to see what
link that node represents.  The user can also click and drag a node around the page.
The edges represent a connection between a parent and child link.  Additionally,
clicking on a node will take the user to the link that node represents.
